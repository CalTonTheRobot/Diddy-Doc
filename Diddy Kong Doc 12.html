He is one of the coolest monkeys around, with his peanut pop guns, jetpack, banana potions in tow, you’ll be hard pressed to find a gun slinging monkey as unique as Diddy Kong.

He is a creation of the British company Rare Ltd., which produced many successful Donkey Kong games that Diddy Kong either starred or co-starred in, but after Rare lost their rights to the Donkey Kong franchise due to Microsoft purchasing the company from Nintendo, who kept the rights of all Donkey Kong series characters, including Diddy Kong, he went on to become a regular character in spin-off Mario franchise titles.

Diddy sports a red shirt with yellow stars and a red hat with the Nintendo logo printed on it. The name "Diddy" is a slang word used in some parts of northern England for "small," as Diddy Kong is. Diddy Kong has gone on many adventures by himself, occasionally with his girlfriend Dixie Kong. </p>
